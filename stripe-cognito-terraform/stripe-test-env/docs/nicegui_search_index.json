All other bindings are sometimes called \"active links\".\n    If you bind a label text to some dictionary entry or an attribute of a custom data model,\n    NiceGUI's binding module has to actively check if the value changed.\n    This is done in a `refresh_loop()` which runs every 0.1 seconds.\n    The interval can be configured via `binding_refresh_interval` in `ui.run()`.\n\nThe \"bindable properties\" are very efficient and don't cost anything as long as the values don't change.\nBut the \"active links\" need to check all bound values 10 times per second.\nThis can get costly, especially if you bind to complex objects like lists or dictionaries.\n\nBecause it is crucial not to block the main thread for too long,\nwe show a warning if one step of the `refresh_loop()` takes too long.\nYou can configure the threshold via `binding.MAX_PROPAGATION_TIME` which defaults to 0.01 seconds.\nBut often the warning is a valuable indicator for a performance or memory issue.\nIf your CPU would be busy updating bindings a significant duration,\nnothing else could happen on the main thread and the UI \"hangs\".\n\nThe following demo shows how to define and use bindable properties for a `Demo` class like in the first demo.\nThe `number` property is now a `BindableProperty`,\nwhich allows NiceGUI to detect write access and trigger the value propagation immediately.",

      "content": "\n    NiceGUI provides UI _elements_ such as buttons, sliders, text, images, charts, and more.\n    Your app assembles these components into _pages_.\n    When the user interacts with an item on a page, NiceGUI triggers an _event_ (or _action_).\n    You define code to _handle_ each event, such as what to do when a user clicks a button, modifies a value or operates a slider.\n    Elements can also be bound to a _model_ (data object), which automatically updates the user interface when the model value changes.\n\n    Elements are arranged on a page using a \"declarative UI\" or \"code-based UI\".\n    That means that you also write structures like grids, cards, tabs, carousels, expansions, menus, and other layout elements directly in code.\n    This concept has been made popular with Flutter and SwiftUI.\n    For readability, NiceGUI utilizes Python's `with ...` statement.\n    This context manager provides a nice way to indent the code to resemble the layout of the UI.\n\n    Styling and appearance can be controlled in several ways.\n    Most elements accept optional arguments for common styling and behavior changes, such as button icons or text color.\n    Because NiceGUI is a web framework, you can change almost any appearance of an element with CSS.\n    But elements also provide `.classes` and `.props` methods to apply Tailwind CSS and Quasar properties\n    which are more high-level and simpler to use day-to-day after you get the hang of it.\n",
